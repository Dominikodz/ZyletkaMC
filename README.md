<summary>Python http.server and ngrok server</summary>
<br>
This may vary with Linux and Windows method. <br>
Open 2 admin cmds/terminals. On first, you will have to start python server; Type:
<pre>
python -m http.server 80
</pre>
Before starting ngrok server, look how to do it, because you will have to upload ngrok token. On the second cmd/terminal, type:
<pre>
ngrok.exe http 80
</pre>

Of course, you can also port forward port 80 to skip ngrok thing, <strong>but for security reasons, it's not recomended for personal use!</strong>
